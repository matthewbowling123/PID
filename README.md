# PID Project
For this project we were asked to make a project that uses PID in some way. We choose a simple but difficult project. A box with a wheel in which a photointeruptor wuld read the amount of rotationd and display on an LCD screen. A rotary ecoder would be used to change the wheels speed.
## CAD

This CAD was comprised of a box held together by brackets which contained a Metro, An LCD screen, a Photointeruptor, and a Motor. There was also a batery pack outside the box. Because of how simple the design is, there was very minimal difficulty creating this CAD. Thankfully only one part needed to be 3D printed which ultimatly limited the cost of the project.

## Reflection
This assignment ultimatly proved itself very difficult for my partner and I. Though the Cad design itself was very simple, The code took a lot of effort to create and much of it was borrowed from other people. A big thanks to all three Weders for their code and their brilliant documentations which I learned a lot from. I think ultimatly if we had more time planning out the project we would have gotten further.
